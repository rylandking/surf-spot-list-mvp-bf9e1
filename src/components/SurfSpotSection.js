            Airport Rights' surf is an intermediate right reef break.

The waves at Airport Rights are at their best with a 13 to 16 second Southwest swell at around 3 to 5 feet. If you get it with a light East wind at low tide, it’ll be close to as good as it gets — it’s a 4 star surf spot, so that means the surf would be insanely fun for intermediate surfers.

The best time to surf Airport Rights is in May, June, July or August.
